# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

CLick here to see the app: https://griffinjoshs.github.io/HW5-JQuery-todo/

## Built with jQuery

* This application allows you to schedule your day and plan it according to each hour 

* The html and bootstrap is carefully set up to match the stylesheet given in the folder. 

* I have built my jQuery to be able to store each saved entry in local storage so that the data saved can be maintained on the page after a refresh. 

* I then set the moment.js api to keep track of the hours of the day 

* If the hour is in the past, its background color will stay grey

* If the hour is in the present, its background color will turn red

* If the hour is in the future, its background color will turn green
